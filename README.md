# Vanillatmosphere


### Why?
I was tired of seeing so-called "vanilla" packs that often contained a lot of homebrew with unmaintained configurations so I made mine which is currently manual (I do it myself) but later I will make it automatic.

### what is in this pack?
latest version of :
- [Atmosphere-NX /
Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)
- [CTCaer /
hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate)
- [fortheusers /
hb-appstore ](https://github.com/fortheusers/hb-appstore)
- sigpatches from private sources
- configs maintained by me
